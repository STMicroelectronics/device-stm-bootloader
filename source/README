How to load bootloader source
========================================
After standard source ./build/envsetup.sh, you can execute from ANDROID_BUILD_TOP
directory "load_bootloader" script without any parameter:

 $ load_bootloader

It's not required to source this script.

Script adaptation (if required)
========================================
Following constants can be modified if required within the load_bootloader script:
- SOC_NAME => currently set to "stm32mp1"
- FSBL_VERSION (primary bootloader) => currently set to 1.5
- SSBL_VERSION (secondary bootloader) => currently set to 2018.03

The name of the input configuration file = android_bootloader.config
